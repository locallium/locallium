# Locallium
Hello, I am **Locallium** / **Locallia**. I originate and also currently live in Riga, Latvia, a small country in the northeast of Europe. Currently I am studying engineering including physics and chemistry. A few years ago I taught myself programming, as well as a few other useful skills within IT. Back then I had a dream of being able to create absolutely everything I wanted. As my skills grew, one of my friends started giving me ideas, in the end we decided to create a dev project together.

## Script Projects
The first ideas behind Script Projects started to appear back in 2020. Back then Script Projects went through a few renamings, we were named Team Script, Script Gen, and only then Script Projects. The whole idea stayed the same along the timeline - Script Projects is a parent of many projects we develop within. As unfortunate as it was, circumstances forbid us to work efficiently, hence the small amount we have right now (this we hope to change). We suffered a few discontinuations of ideas, we suffered lack of motivation, lack of creativity, also capacity to actually develop those projects. Taking a fresh start on an almost blank sheet of paper, we are planning a few new projects at the moment, brainstorming to our fullest, planning the capacities and workflow, promising the desired output this time. You may feel free to follow our social media, where updates, progress, and other news will be published regarding our newest projects.
