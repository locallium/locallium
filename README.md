# Locallium

- Hello, I am Locallium / Locallia. I originate and also currently live in Riga, Latvia, a small country in the northeast of Europe. Currently I am studying engineering including physics and chemistry. A few years ago I taught myself programming, as well as a few other useful skills I could use to make some of my own ideas reality. With all that together with the help of a dear friend of mine, we are happy to at least try bringing some of our projects to life. We decided to create a parent project, which unironically is named "Script Projects".

### My projects

- Currently we have decided to discontinue a few projects that used to be in development within Script Projects. This does mean that the amount of projects currently available has dropped significantly. All other projects that we have decided to keep are now undergoing updates and upgrades. If you wish to stay updated, feel free to follow the official social media of Script Projects.

1. Techno - undergoing severe updates
2. PrismAI - discontinued
3. Survival Extremes - discontinued

4. Project [undisclosed] - there is another project we had in the concept stage that we decided to partially/completely rewrite. We are eager to provide more updates as soon as we can!

### Inquiries, issues

- If you have any issues, inquiries, suggestions, etc., feel free to either create an issue on this repository, ~~e-mail me via localscript@scriptprojects.cf~~ (due to the discontinuation of the website, the domained e-mails are currently having trouble being contacted, please refrain from contacting us on these e-mails for the meantime), direct message us on any social media of Script Projects, or via Discord - `locallium`.

Have a nice day! ðŸ˜‰
